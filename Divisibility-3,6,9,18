*****GGB script-to check the divisibility of the number by 3,6,9,and 18 ******
a=1
b=1
c=1
d=1
e=1
f=1
g=1
h=a+10b+100c+1000d+10000e+100000f+1000000g
Create a input box linking h
k=a+b+c+d+e+f+g
i=Mod(h,3)
j=Mod(h,6)
l=Mod(h,9)
m=Mod(h,18)
n=Mod(h,2)
If(i==0,"The number is divisible by 3","The number is not divisible by 3")
If(l==0,"The number is divisible by 9","The number is not divisible by 9")
If(j==0,"The number is divisible by 6",If(n==0,"The number is divisible by 6","The number is not divisible by 6"))
If(m==0,"The number is divisible by 18","The number is not divisible by 18")
